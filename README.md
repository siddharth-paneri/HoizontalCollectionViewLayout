# HoizontalCollectionViewLayout

This is more of a paging layout, which enables collection view to layout cells horizontally per page. 

### Pre-development

Before starting to develop lets understand what we are trying to acheive. Initial idea was to develop something similar to this -

### Post-development

This is our final output, we also implemented page control that shows which page we are currently on and a random count button which will help us to create random items.

Note, this was developed on specific requirements for one of my projects.
